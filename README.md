# QueueSpot - A hospital queue visibility platform

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a web-based platform that enables patients to identify nearby hospitals or clinics with shorter wait times and lower queue congestion, allowing them to make informed decisions and reduce treatment delays.

*The platform aims to  improve healthcare accessibility by providing near real-time visibility into hospital queues and estimated waiting times with the number of available beds.*

## Problem Statement

The Canadian healthcare system is currently facing a severe crisis due to:

* Overcrowded emergency rooms

* Excessive patient wait times

* Lack of transparency regarding hospital queue status

* Patients travelling blindly to healthcare facilities with unknown delays

> Reports indicate that around 23,746 to 24,000 deaths reported while waiting for care in the period of April 2024 - March 2025, highlighting the urgent need for better patient flow management.

Currently, patients have no centralized, real-time system to check wait times before reaching a hospital or clinic.

## Solution Overview

The proposed system provides:

* A patient-facing web portal to search nearby hospitals

* Visibility into current queue length and estimated waiting time

* A hospital admin interface to update queue status

* Real-time or near real-time data propagation
